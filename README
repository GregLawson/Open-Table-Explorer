Installation:
Requires previous installation of ruby interpreter and Rails. 
Some individual programs require nmap and wget be installed.
Installation of ruby rails is optional with this version but will be required for future versons. The ruby rails code is in the subdirectory rails but the doc and vendor directories
have not been included as they are standard and not changed.
The database used is called energy_development following the ruby rails convention for a database still being written.
A ruby rails definition of the databases is in rails/db/schema.rb.
If you are on a private net of the form w.x.y.z, network.rb will search all hosts w.x.0-y.1-254 for supported web interfaces. If y is a large number or 0 to y-1 are networks 
that you shouldn't scan, don't run this version.
