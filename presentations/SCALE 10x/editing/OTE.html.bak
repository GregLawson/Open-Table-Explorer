<h1>Intro</h1>
<ul>
<li>I was forced to present by Jordan's threats.</li>
<li>I wanted to delay because my open
source project doesn't have a downloadable demo yet.</li>
<li>This project is completing the Proof-of-Concept stage</li>
<li>In Barry Boehm's Spiral Model, the first spiral has been completed, resulting in choosing a single architecture.</li>
<li> But I hope this talk will prove interesting, even inspiring, as its wildly
ambitious, strongly open source, as well as unapologetically nerdy. </li>
<li>It also
provides my answer to the question, "If you don't have a job, and you
aren't desperate to find one, what software would you write?"

<h1>The Metaphorical Problems to Be Solved</h1>
<ul>
<li>We Are Starving In the Midst Of Plenty</li>
<li>How Do We, "Think Globally, Act Locally."</li>
<li>Hint: Even though these metaphors come from other contexts, the solutions will have something to do with this project and home engineering.</li>

<h1>We Are Starving In the Midst Of Plenty</h1>
<ul>
<li>By plenty, I mean the vast data and software resources of the Internet.</li>
<li>By starving, I mean the inability to solve our problems. I define problem solving as:</li>
<ul>
<li>analyze available facts and data</li>
<li>predict the future</li>
<li>respond to error feedback (difference between prediction and reality)</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<div class="slide">
<h1>This Starving Metaphor</h1>
<ul>
<li>This metaphor is meant to motivate our compassion and dispell the illusion that we are powerless.</li>
<li>If you want us to continue to starve in the midst of plenty, look for solutions from celebreties, politicians, and journalists.</li>
<li>If you want real solutions, look to altruistic and useful engineers.</li>
</ul>

<div class="slide">
<h1>How Do We, "Think Globally, Act Locally."</h1>
<ul>
<li>I believe the best way to think globally is engineering.</li>
<ul>
<li>Engineering is the application of science and experience to solving practical problems.
</li>
</ul>
<li>The Locality Principal</li>
<ul>
<li>We are most efficient when acting locally (close in space and time)</li>
<li>Computers are more efficient using small, fast local memory (registers, caches) than large, slow global memories (disk drives and network storage)</li>
<li>We think more efficiently about abstractions that fit in our consciousness and short term memory than about the realities that won't fit in our brains.</li>
<li>Home is local.</li>

<h1>Project Evolution</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<https://github.com/GregLawson/Open-Table-Explorer/wiki>
The project consists of an application and a framework.
</li>
<li>I started with the application Home Energy Explorer to analyze my home
energy consumption and solar panel production as a function of
weather.</li>
<li>But I thought that was a crappy open source project since you would
need the same expensive hardware to run it.</li>
<li>So I decided to factor
out the weird hardware and code into tables, thus was born the general
purpose, does everything, framework Open Table Explorer.</li>
<li>Since developing software is hard, I wanted to write as little code as possible, so I
delegated all the heavy lifting to Ruby Rails, SQL, R, and the ruby
language as a Domain Specific Language (DSL).</li>
</ul>

<h1>What Is a Stream?</h1>
<ul>
<li>A Stream is a ruby class that abstracts as much useful data management architecture as possible.</li>
<li>A stream can be visualized as a possibly infinite table consisting of rows and columns.</li>
<li>Stream Data Buffers can be implemented as</li>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Array.html">Array</a> of <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Hash.html">Hashes</a> of name => value pairs</li>
<li>ActiveRecord  -  When implemented as a SQL database, an id primary key is added along with  a creation and update time-stamp. A logical primary key is added as a unique index to prevent duplicate entries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ruby Expressions</li>
<li>A Statistical model</li>

</ul>
<div class="handout">
A Stream is a ruby class that abstracts as much useful data management architecture as possible. A stream can be visualized as a possibly infinite table consisting of rows and columns. Each column has a unique [[2.2.9. Column Data Types]]. This project intends to leave most data management issues to the underlying database management systems. Since Ruby Rails has been chosen as the user interface and database interface, the capabilities [[2.2.2.-ActiveRecord]] abstracts from or simulates on top of the underlying database system are the easiest to support. The tools specific to the underlying database system are still available, since [[2.2.2.-ActiveRecord]] makes few demands on the underlying database.
</div>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Stream Storage Life-cycle</h1>
Eventually each stream input is eventually consumed and deleted, to avoid an unbounded need to buy more disk drives. But for practical reasons some data's consumption is delayed indefinitely:
<ul>
<li>Test data, error messages, and historical trends are saved to support development.
</li>
<li>Statistics that representing a set of historical values that are well enough characterized that the original data provides little added-value.  
</li>
<li>data representing external objects with long life-cycles.
</li>
<li>supporting data for a statistical model. Training data, interesting outliers, context around anomalies. It is assumed that for large data sets this supporting data is much smaller than keeping all acquired data.
</li>

<h1>Rationale</h1>
<ul>
<li>Why Open? Table? Explorer? Home? Energy? SQL? ruby? rails? R?</li>
<li>Cognitive Biases</li>

</ul>
<div class="handout">
[any material that should appear in print but not on the slide]
</div>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Why Open?</h1>
<ul>
<li>While software consists of both source and data, I do not believe enough attention has been paid to Open Data.</li>
<li>
For years (from some of the earliest versions) I used Quicken to record my financial data. I abandoned using Quicken when I realized after years of exhaustive work putting my data into Quicken, I did not own that data. I could not use my data in the ways I believed I had every right to do so. When I ran out of disk space, my Quicken data file became corrupted, and unrecoverable.</li>
<li>The other major problem is that programs (even open source ones) create data silos or data jails, where data cannot be easily shared between programs. Anyone with a little familiarity with database systems knows that separate copies of the same data are inevitably inconsistent and incomplete.</li>
<li></li>

</ul>
<div class="handout">
[any material that should appear in print but not on the slide]
</div>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Why Table?</h1>
<ul>
<li>A table consists of rows and columns and is believed by data base psychologists as one of the best understood data structures for ordinary users.</li>
<li>SQL databases have inspired the rigorous definitions and the commercial data processing of the world has proven the practicality of tables in numerous fields demanding efficiency, consistency, error control, transparency, and security.</li>
<li>While relational SQL databases provide a mathematically sound approach to the analysis of digital data, statistical analysis packages bring clarity to analog data. Fortunately statistical analysis programs support tables quite well.</li>
<li></li>

</ul>
<div class="handout">
[any material that should appear in print but not on the slide]
</div>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Why Home Energy Explorer?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Why Explorer? - This is an attempt to provide useful software by focusing on a narrow range of functionality first. An explorer focuses on data navigation and simple, basic data analysis.</li>
<li>Why Home? - This is an attempt to focus on what a single person can comprehend and afford. Small business is equally applicable. Even a single person's view of a corporate monstrosity is applicable.</li>
<li>Why Energy? - Energy is a concept from physics with huge applicability and yet the average person has a workable understanding. Energy is often highly correlated with economics. Our energy savings could conceivably fund this project.</li>

</ul>
<div class="handout">
[any material that should appear in print but not on the slide]
</div>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Why Ruby?</h1>
<ul>
<li> Ruby was chosen as an ideal tool to parse Internet text data. </li>
<li>I would have used Perl, but my Perl code has proven unmaintainable.</li>
<li>As a dynamically typed scripting language, it is well suited to the project goal of interactively discovering the data types of tables from unknown sources.</li>
<li>Ruby supports internal Domain Specific Languages (DSL). This project provides a DSL for Data Analysis embedded  in the ruby language. Thus the following two design goals are supported:</li>
<ul>
<li>Easy things should be easy via the web interface</li>
<li>Hard things should still be possible via the DSL.</li>
</ul>
<li>Macro processing and meta-programming are well integrated.</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
<li>Ruby code can be introspective even self-referential.</li>
<li>Ruby is quietly ambitious as a programming language.</li>
</div>
</div><div class="slide">
<h1>Why Ruby Rails?</h1>
<ul>
<li>I want to interact with my programs and data from any computer in my house or elsewhere. </li>
<li>I wanted a rich graphical interface which people would not need to be trained to use.</li>
<li>I love the Internet.</li>
<li> These requirements led to the selection of the browser interface. </li>
<li>Ruby Rails was the interesting open source package that supported ruby, database, and web interfaces.</li>
<li>Rails scaffolding provides a relative easy way to generate  skeleton CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) interface code.</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
[any material that should appear in print but not on the slide]
</div>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Why SQL Databases?</h1>
<ul>
<li>The Internet currently consists of vast stores of data, but the human brain is the bottleneck in its understanding. </li>
<li>Some of this complexity is inherent in the problems we are trying to solve, but much of the complexity is artificial and can be hidden by the right glue software.</li>
<li>One obvious problem of the Internet is that that vast amount of data is not in a form where it can be computationally combined.</li>
<li>In contrast, data bases provide an algebra for selection, projection, aggregation, and grouping for any digital data. </li>
<li>Since most large web servers on the Internet are in fact built on databases, the translation of this data into your own database is fairly straight forward.</li>


</ul>
<div class="handout">
[any material that should appear in print but not on the slide]
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Why Statistical Analysis Programs?</h1>
<ul>
<li>As powerful as database management programs are in the digital domain, they are rather feeble in the analog domain. </li>
<li>The type of software that provides powerful analog analysis is statistical analysis programs. Such package can uncover the hidden structure in our data.</li>
<li>While it is often said that "correlation is not causation", it is hard to imagine prediction and control with out correlation.</li>
<li>The most inspiring approach to statistics is Exploratory Data Analysis as developed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tukey"> John Tukey</a>.</li>
<li>The program Data Desk implemented these principals well over a decade ago, but has not been updated substantially since. I know of no open source equivalent, though there have been many attempts which could be supported.</li>
<li>In the Open Table Explorer, I hope to support a nice feature of Data Desk: suggested data analyses based on the types of the columns in your table.</li>

<h1>Cognitive Biases</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_amnesia">Source Amnesia</a> where we forget or choose not to remember where our beliefs come from.</li>
<li>Narrative Fallacy</li>
<li></li>

</ul>
<div class="handout">
[any material that should appear in print but not on the slide]
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Narrative Fallacy</h1>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb#Narrative_Fallacy Narrative Fallacy">Narrative Fallacy</a> is a cognitive bias where people will believe a story about data even if that story is contradicted by the data itself</li>
<li>Probably the greatest example is politics versus engineering: In politics, you can succeed with an appealing story, no matter how far it strays from the data, while in engineering the farther you stray from the data the greater your risk of failure.</li>
<li>The Narrative Fallacy is exacerbated by the intellectual and social distance between a scientifically educated minority and the rest of the population.</li>
<li>Even among intellectuals there is the gulf between the sciences and the humanities described as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Cultures">The Two Cultures]</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb#Narrative_Fallacy Narrative Fallacy">Narrative Fallacy</a> is in the spirit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman">Kahneman and Tversky</a>. Their cognitive bias of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representativeness_heuristic representativeness] overlaps with the Narrative Fallacy, though with a different emphasis.</li>

Statistically telling things apart is called discrimination (i.g. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis Wikipedia linear discriminant analysis]. A device signature is a way of telling devices apart in a single measurement time series; that is devices with the same device signature cannot be told apart.   The following table includes increasingly complicated algorithms needing increasingly more data to discriminate between device signatures. Each algorithm adds another dimension to the discrimination space:
