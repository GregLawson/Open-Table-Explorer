<p style="direction:ltr;">Audience</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">While this presentation focuses on fairly advanced developer methodologies, it attempts to generalize to less demanding problem solving and thus should be of interest to programmers, operations, data analysts and knowledge workers of all kinds.</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">Biography</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">As a boy, Greg wanted to be a genius when he grew up. The closest he got was getting perfect scores on both of his math SATs. Then he learned nobody cared unless he could make his peculiar talents socially useful. A biting put-down was, &quot;If you're so smart, why aren't you rich?&quot;  Finding himself unsuited to manual labor, he returned to college, fell in love with computers, earned a BS in Engineering from UCLA, and won a Hughes Masters Fellowship to study Computer Science at UCLA. For three decades he learned how to build software systems for operating and testing airborne and space infrared and radar systems. It was an excellent education but only occasionally socially useful. Around 2000, he discovered open source software. Later he discovered cheap electronic mini-boards and realized he didn't need any large institutions as intermediaries to being socially useful.</p>
