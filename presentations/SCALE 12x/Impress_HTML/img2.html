<h3>Notes:</h3><br>

<p><p style="direction:ltr;">Over the last thirty years neuro-scientists and psychologists have been studying the modularity of the brain, heuristics and biases. </p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">Functional MR scans have shown the spatial modularity of the brain.</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">Psychologist Daniel Kahneman's book “Thinking Fast and Slow” describes fast thinking heuristics which imply cognitive modularity.</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">Most of our lives are spent with fast thinking and slow thinking appears rather lazy. Slow thinking is generally only invoked when fast thinking provides conflicting or no answers (e.g. hard math problems) and there is enough glucose available for fuel.</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">Two fast thinking heuristics most relevant to software development are replacing a hard problem with an easier one and over-confidence.</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">Divide and conquer is the heuristic programmers use repeatedly to turn a hard problem into a collection of easier problems.</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">Because divide and conquer is not guaranteed to succeed, it is usually paired with the successive refinement heuristic to check that progress is being made toward your goal.</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">The over-confidence heuristic can keep us motivated to solve hard problems.</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">Over-confidence also leads to forgetting to check if the easy problems you solved really solve the hard problem you need to solve and skimping on test coverage.</p>
