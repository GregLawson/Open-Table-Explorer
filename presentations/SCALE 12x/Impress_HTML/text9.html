<h1 style="direction:ltr;">Testing allows sorting enhancements and bugs into different git branches</h1>
<br>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p style="direction:ltr;">The simplest workflow in Git consists of a single branch called master to which you commit code when you feel like it. The commits of code that passes all of its tests are indistinguishable from a commit of a catastrophic bug.</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">Testing allows sorting enhancements and bugs into different git branches. Since adding branches tends to increase overhead, you will want to minimize the number of branches and automate the management of the separate branches.</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">It is relatively easy to classify a test run as passed, test failure, or syntax error. The edited branch accepts any commit including syntax errors. The testing branch accepts commits with failing tests but no syntax errors. The passed branch accepts commits units for whom all tests passed. The master branch checkpoints the passed branch when all unit and integration tests have passed and is a candidate for release.</p>
