<h1 style="direction:ltr;">Brain Modularity from a 
Computer Science Perspective</h1>
<ul><li style="direction:ltr;"><h2>Brain modularity should sound familiar to software engineers are often expert in modularity, heuristics and biases.</h2></li>
<li style="direction:ltr;"><h2>The modularity of the brain should be no surprise to an architect of parallel processors. Highly parallel computing often gains speed by reducing communications delays between physically separate modular processors. One of the commonest ways to reduce communication overhead is to replace complex algorithms by heuristics that usually work but may be globally inconsistent.</h2></li>
<li style="direction:ltr;"><h2>The physical modularity of the brain is driven by some of the same constraints that drive parallel computer architectures</h2></li>
<ul><li style="direction:ltr;">Communication delays are a major cause of slow computations</li>
<li style="direction:ltr;">Data is local, not all data is available for all computations</li>
<li style="direction:ltr;">Fast computations  are often simple computations that are usually good enough</li>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p style="direction:ltr;">Brain modularity should sound familiar to software engineers are often expert in modularity, heuristics and biases.</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">The modularity of the brain should be no surprise to an architect of parallel processors. Highly parallel computing often gains speed by reducing communications delays between physically separate modular processors. One of the commonest ways to reduce communication overhead is to replace complex algorithms by heuristics that usually work but may be globally inconsistent.</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">Interestingly Natural selection and learning use successive refinement (also known as guess and check) and will favor local incremental changes.</p>
