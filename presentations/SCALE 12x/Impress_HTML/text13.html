<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p style="direction:ltr;">The Goldilocks Display shows three versions of a file. The version from the passed branch is too small as it doesn't contain the new enhancements. The version from the testing branch is too big since while it includes the new enhancements, it also includes new bugs. Goldilocks's job is to create the “just right” version by merging lines from the other files until as many enhancements as possible but no bugs have been merged.</p>
