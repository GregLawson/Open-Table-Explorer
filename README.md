Open-Table-Explorer
===================

An engine for capturing data from almost anywhere and passing it to SQL or R (statistical analysis)

Currently this is developed as a single repository as this is simplest for a single developer with frequent changes in architecture. If a developer were interested in working on a subset, sub-repositories could be created. The following is an outline of the structure of the project and likely sub-repositories:
